## Now How to do the contributions ⁉️ 💭

1. Find a suitable project from our project dashboard 📝

   We have a suite of in house repos and we are also promoting awesome projects made by contributors like you in our project dashboard. Select any one of the projects you like go through its readme understand the project. If you understand the project and want to contribute in it keep reading further, If you think its too difficult for you try any other project.

2. Try to find a suitable issue 📍

   If you have understood the project, its time to find a suitable issue to get a head start. Go to the issue tab, try to see its labels. If you find some issues labeled `good-first-issue` or `easy` or something in the similar lines. Open the issue and read through it. Try to understand what is the problem being pointed out. Check if some one is already been assigned to the issue. it it has been their name will be in the right side column. If no one has been assigned. **Its up for grab!** 🎉 🎉 Leave a comment asking the maintainer to assign you the issue.

3. Issue assigned ✅

   After you have been assigned to a issue. Its time to start the real work. Create a fork of the repo before proceeding. Clone your fork in your local environemnt. And work on the issue you have been assigned.

4. Write a Good Commit Message 😇

   You have written some valiad quality code in your branch, and are ready to commit. So, make sure to written good, clean commit message.
   Let's review the anatomy of a commit message.

   ***

   First line, no more than 50 characters (this is considered as title in github)

   Details section (this is considered as description), as long as you want. Not always necessary/mandatory, but
   available if you need it. Wrapped at 72 characters. Present imperative
   tense is preferred for commits. That means "fix bug", not "fixes bug" or
   "fixed bug". And don't forget to tell how your project works...

   - Use bullets if you need
   - Bullets are a good way to summarize a few things

   If you have too much info here, it might be a good candidate to break
   down into multiple commits. You can even use emojis here too :sparkles:

   ***

5. Push to your fork on github ⏫

   Push your changes to the remote fork you made on github. Push command generally looks like this:

   ```sh
       git push origin main
   ```

   Here,

   - `git` is the tool
   - `push` is the action we are performing
   - `origin` is the general alias used to refer to the remote repository in github
   - `main` it is branch which contains our changes. We are pushing changes made to this branch to our github repo.

6. Lastly, submit your Pull Request 😎

   In your forked repository on github you would see a prompt mentioning your branch head is ahead or behind (depending on the situation) the head of the main repo. And a option to contribute will be there. Click that button and follow the instructions given by github to create `pull request` or PR in the main repo. If everything looks good to the maintainer they will accept it right away or if they thing something needs to change they will revert back. Generally there is always some to and fro between you and the maintainer. Don't get frustrated or be intimidated. After some time your PR will be merged.

7. You have made your contribution in the FOSS world. 🥳

   Everyone in this FoSS world works on voluntary basis in their free time. So, sometimes it may take some time to get replies don't get disheartedned by this fact.
